## Reviving the "No Scalping Zone"

Remember the informal marketplaces outside stadiums in the 90s? Where people would hold up signs saying "Need an extra!" or "Selling one!"? This is the digital, decentralized version of that community-driven ticket exchange:

- **Self-Organizing**: No platform controlling access or extracting fees
- **Community Trust**: Face-to-face interaction builds accountability
- **Fair Pricing**: Market-driven prices without artificial markups
- **Local Focus**: Connect with fans in your area attending the same event

## Troubleshooting

### "No tickets available"

- Try different channels (switch between #mesh and geohash channels)
- Search for the specific event name
- Create a "wanted" listing to let sellers know you're looking

### "Can't contact seller"

- Check connection status (Bluetooth or Nostr)
- Ensure you're in the same geohash channel for Nostr discovery
- Try sending a public message mentioning their nickname

### "Listing not appearing"

- Verify you're broadcasting to the correct channel
- Check that event date is in the future (past events filter out)
- Ensure you have Bluetooth or internet connectivity

## Future Enhancements

The ticket exchange is built on extensible P2P infrastructure. Potential future features:

- **Reputation System**: Track successful exchanges
- **Escrow Integration**: Optional crypto/lightning escrow
- **Verified Tickets**: Integration with venue APIs
- **Rating System**: Buyer/seller ratings
- **Group Purchases**: Split ticket packages among friends

## Community Guidelines

2. **Be Honest**: Accurate ticket details and availability
3. **Communicate Clearly**: Respond to inquiries promptly
4. **Complete Transactions**: Honor your commitments
