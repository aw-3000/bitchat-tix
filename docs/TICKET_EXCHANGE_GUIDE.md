3. Fill in event details and your offer price
4. Post the listing
5. Sellers with available tickets can contact you

## The Companion Seating Feature

### The Problem

You bought two tickets to see your favorite band, but your friend bailed. Now you have an extra ticket and face a dilemma:
- Sell it to anyone and risk sitting next to someone incompatible (loud talker, different music taste, etc.)
- Go alone and leave the seat empty
- Skip the show entirely

### The Solution: Companion Seating

Companion seating lets you indicate that you're **attending the event yourself** and looking for a **compatible person** to buy your extra ticket. Instead of ending up next to a random stranger, you can:

1. **Screen potential buyers** through chat before committing
2. **Share your preferences** (age range, interests, vibe)
3. **Find like-minded fans** who will enhance your experience
4. **Make new friends** while keeping 100% of your ticket money

### How It Works

**For Sellers:**
1. When creating a listing, toggle "I'm attending & looking for a compatible companion"
2. Add your preferences (e.g., "Mid-20s, die-hard Radiohead fan, chill vibes")
3. Your listing gets a special 👥 COMPANION badge
4. Chat with interested buyers to ensure compatibility
5. Meet up and enjoy the show together!

**For Buyers:**
1. Filter for "👥 Companion Seats" in the marketplace
2. Read seller's companion preferences
3. If you match, reach out via private chat
4. Get to know each other before committing
5. Complete the transaction and make a new concert buddy!

### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Concert Companion**
> "25F, have an extra ticket to Phoebe Bridgers. Looking for another fan in their 20s who loves sad girl indie. Let's cry together 😭🎵"

**Example 2: Sports Fan**
> "30M Lakers fan, extra ticket for tonight's game. Looking for someone who actually watches basketball and won't be on their phone the whole time. Let's go Lakers! 🏀"

**Example 3: Festival Friends**
> "23F going to Coachella alone, have 2 camping passes. Looking for other solo festival-goers who want to camp together. Good vibes only! 🌵✨"

### Why This Matters

The traditional ticket marketplace treated seats as commodities, ignoring the social aspect of live events. But experiences are better with the right company! Companion seating brings back the community aspect of live events while maintaining the benefits of P2P exchange:

- **Social Compatibility**: Find people you'll actually enjoy sitting with
- **Safety**: Chat and vet buyers before meeting
- **Enhanced Experience**: Turn a solo experience into a shared memory
- **Zero Fees**: Still keep 100% of your money
- **New Connections**: Make friends who share your interests

### Tips for Companion Listings

**Creating Good Preferences:**
- Be specific but friendly
- Mention age range, interests, or vibe
- Keep it light and welcoming
- Examples: "30s, love classic rock", "anime fans welcome", "chill and respectful vibes"

**Vetting Potential Companions:**
- Chat before committing to the sale
- Ask about their interest in the event
- Share social media if comfortable
- Trust your instincts
- Meet in a public place first

**At the Event:**
- Exchange contact info for coordination
- Agree on a meetup spot
- Be punctual and communicative
- Respect boundaries
- Have fun together!

## Reviving the "No Scalping Zone"

Remember the informal marketplaces outside stadiums in the 90s? Where people would hold up signs saying "Need an extra!" or "Selling one!"? This is the digital, decentralized version of that community-driven ticket exchange:

- **Self-Organizing**: No platform controlling access or extracting fees
- **Community Trust**: Face-to-face interaction builds accountability
- **Fair Pricing**: Market-driven prices without artificial markups
- **Local Focus**: Connect with fans in your area attending the same event

## Troubleshooting

### "No tickets available"

- Try different channels (switch between #mesh and geohash channels)
- Search for the specific event name
- Create a "wanted" listing to let sellers know you're looking

### "Can't contact seller"

- Check connection status (Bluetooth or Nostr)
- Ensure you're in the same geohash channel for Nostr discovery
- Try sending a public message mentioning their nickname

### "Listing not appearing"

- Verify you're broadcasting to the correct channel
- Check that event date is in the future (past events filter out)
- Ensure you have Bluetooth or internet connectivity

## Future Enhancements

The ticket exchange is built on extensible P2P infrastructure. Potential future features:

- **Reputation System**: Track successful exchanges
- **Escrow Integration**: Optional crypto/lightning escrow
- **Verified Tickets**: Integration with venue APIs

## Community Guidelines

2. **Be Honest**: Accurate ticket details and availability
3. **Communicate Clearly**: Respond to inquiries promptly
4. **Complete Transactions**: Honor your commitments
