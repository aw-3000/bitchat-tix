- Validates UX concepts early
- Can iterate independently

**Track 3: Documentation Drafting**
- Technical Writer drafts user guide structure
- Creates safety and best practices content
- Can work from spec before code complete

**Track 4: Test Planning**
- QA Engineer creates comprehensive test plans
- Identifies test scenarios and edge cases
- Prepares test infrastructure

**Track 5: Security Analysis**
- Security Engineer performs threat modeling
- Reviews architecture for vulnerabilities
- Prepares security requirements

### Synchronization Points

**Week 1 End**: Architecture Review
- Tech Lead presents finalized architecture
- All teams align on data models and APIs
- Adjust plans based on decisions

**Week 2 End**: Integration Planning
- Backend API surface finalized
- Frontend components ready for integration
- Integration test scenarios defined

**Week 3 End**: Feature Complete
- All major features implemented
- Bug bash with entire team
- Documentation draft complete

**Week 4 End**: Launch Readiness
- All tests passing
- Security audit complete
- Documentation published
- Production deployment ready

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Async Standup (Slack/Chat)
**Format**: Each person posts by 10am
- âœ… What I completed yesterday

### Weekly Team Meeting (1 hour)
**Agenda**:
- Demo completed features (15 mins)
- Architecture/design discussion (20 mins)
- Risk review (10 mins)
- Planning next week (15 mins)

### Ad-Hoc Pairing Sessions
- Schedule as needed for complex integrations
- Particularly important for Backend/Frontend sync
- Security Engineer pairs with devs on security fixes
