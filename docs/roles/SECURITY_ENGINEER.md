# Security Engineer - Decentralized Ticket Exchange Project

## Role Overview
As Security Engineer, you are responsible for ensuring the ticket marketplace maintains the same high security and privacy standards as the existing BitChat messaging app. You'll conduct security audits, threat modeling, and ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced.

## Primary Responsibilities
1. **Security Architecture Review** - Validate that new features don't compromise existing security
2. **Threat Modeling** - Identify potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies
3. **Code Review** - Review all security-critical code for vulnerabilities
4. **Privacy Audit** - Ensure no new tracking or data collection introduced
5. **Penetration Testing** - Attempt to exploit the system to find weaknesses

## Key Security Context

### Existing Security Guarantees to Preserve
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All private messages use Noise Protocol (XX pattern)
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of long-term keys doesn't compromise past sessions
- **No Central Server**: Fully decentralized P2P architecture
- **No Accounts**: No persistent user identifiers that can be tracked
- **No Data Collection**: Zero telemetry or analytics
- **Ephemeral by Design**: No persistent message storage

### New Attack Surface
The ticket marketplace introduces:
- **Public Listings**: Broadcast ticket information to the network
- **Transaction Coordination**: Meetup location/time shared between parties
- **Payment Coordination**: Users discuss payment methods (cash, Venmo, etc.)
- **Scam Potential**: Fake tickets, price gouging, no-shows

func testCannotModifyOthersListings() {
    let alice = createUser("Alice")
    let bob = createUser("Bob")
    let aliceListing = alice.createListing(...)
    
    // Bob should not be able to cancel Alice's listing
    XCTAssertThrowsError(bob.cancelListing(aliceListing.id))
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Access control audit
- [ ] Authorization test suite
- [ ] Privilege escalation analysis

// ✅ GOOD - No user data in logs
print("Listing created successfully")
```

**Audit All Logging:**
```bash
# Search for logging that might leak PII
grep -r "print\|NSLog\|os_log" bitchat/
# Review each log statement for PII
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Coding Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
```swift
// Always validate and sanitize user input
func validateEventName(_ name: String) -> Bool {
    // Length check
    guard name.count >= 1 && name.count <= 200 else {
        return false
    }
    // Character whitelist
    let allowed = CharacterSet.alphanumerics
        .union(.whitespaces)
        .union(CharacterSet(charactersIn: "-.,!?'"))
    return name.unicodeScalars.allSatisfy { allowed.contains($0) }
}
```

2. **Safe JSON Parsing**
```swift
// Use proper error handling
func decodeTicketMessage(_ data: Data) -> TicketMessage? {
    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        // Set size limits
        guard data.count < 1_000_000 else { // 1MB max
            return nil
        }
        return try decoder.decode(TicketMessage.self, from: data)
    } catch {
        // Log error without exposing user data
        print("Failed to decode ticket message")
        return nil
    }
}
```

3. **Avoid Force Unwrapping**
```swift
// ❌ BAD - Can crash
let price = Decimal(string: userInput)!

// ✅ GOOD - Safe handling
guard let price = Decimal(string: userInput), price > 0 else {
    return .invalidPrice
}
```

4. **No Sensitive Data in Logs**
```swift
// ❌ BAD
print("User \(peerID) purchased ticket \(ticketID) for \(price)")

// ✅ GOOD
print("Transaction completed successfully")
```

### Security Testing Template

```swift
class SecurityTests: XCTestCase {
    func testInputValidation() {
        // Test all edge cases
    }
    
    func testAuthorizationChecks() {
        // Test access control
    }
    
    func testEncryptionIntegrity() {
        // Verify encryption still works
    }
    
    func testNoDataLeakage() {
        // Check for PII in logs
    }
}
```
