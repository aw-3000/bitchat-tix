# Companion Seating Feature - Technical Overview

## Problem Statement

The original problem: **"I have an extra ticket but don't want to sit next to a stranger"**

This is a common scenario in ticket marketplaces:
- Someone buys tickets with a friend who later cancels
- They want to sell the extra ticket but still plan to attend
- They don't want to end up sitting next to a random stranger
- Existing platforms treat this as a simple commodity transaction

## Solution: Companion Seating

We've implemented a **Companion Seating** feature that transforms the ticket exchange from a purely transactional experience to a **social matching** experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Model Changes (`Ticket.swift`)

Added two new fields to the `Ticket` struct:

```swift
/// Companion preferences - for sellers who plan to attend and want compatible company
let attendingTogether: Bool
let companionPreferences: String?
```

**Design Decisions:**
- `attendingTogether`: Boolean flag that indicates the seller is attending and wants a companion
- `companionPreferences`: Optional free-form text for sellers to describe their ideal seatmate
- Both fields default to `false` and `nil` for backward compatibility
- Fully Codable for network transmission

### 2. UI Changes

#### CreateTicketListingView.swift
- Added toggle: "I'm attending & looking for a compatible companion"
- Conditional text editor for companion preferences (only shown when toggle is enabled)
- Helper text explains the purpose and provides examples
- Only shown for "Sell" listings (not "Buy" requests)

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Progressive disclosure: preferences only shown when toggle is enabled
- Contextual help text with examples
- Footer explanation of the feature's purpose

#### TicketDetailsView.swift
- Special highlighted section for companion listings
- Displays attendingTogether status with ðŸ‘¥ icon
- Shows companion preferences if provided
- Distinctive styling with accent color and border

**Visual Design:**
- Accent color background with opacity for subtle highlight
- Border stroke for additional visual separation
- Person icon (person.2.fill) to reinforce social aspect
- Clear, encouraging messaging

#### TicketMarketplaceView.swift
- Added "ðŸ‘¥ Companion Seats" filter chip
- Companion badge on listing rows (when attendingTogether is true)
- Filter logic to show only companion listings when selected
- Badge appears alongside "WANTED" badge for buy requests

**Filtering Logic:**
- Separate from event type filters (can be used independently)
- Clear visual indicators (ðŸ‘¥ COMPANION badge)
- Sorting maintains chronological order by event date

### 3. Test Coverage

Added comprehensive tests in `TicketMarketplaceTests.swift`:

1. **testCompanionTicketCreation**: Validates creation with preferences
2. **testCompanionListingWithoutPreferences**: Tests attendingTogether without preferences
3. **testRegularTicketDefaults**: Ensures backward compatibility
4. **testCompanionListingCodable**: Validates JSON encoding/decoding

**Test Philosophy:**
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing tickets
- Validate new fields serialize/deserialize correctly
- Test both with and without optional preferences

## Key Features

- No complex filtering logic
- Text preferences kept short (UI guidance)
- No additional API calls needed

### Scalability

- Fully distributed via P2P network
- No central matching service required
- Scales with network size
- No bottlenecks introduced

## Metrics to Track

Success indicators for this feature:

1. **Adoption Rate**: % of sell listings using companion toggle
2. **Conversion Rate**: Companion listings â†’ completed transactions
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on companion experiences
4. **Feature Usage**: Companion filter usage frequency
5. **Network Growth**: New users attracted by feature

2. **TICKET_EXCHANGE_GUIDE.md**: Detailed section with examples
3. **This Document**: Technical overview and rationale

## Conclusion

The Companion Seating feature addresses a real pain point in ticket marketplaces while aligning perfectly with BitChat's P2P, privacy-first philosophy. By enabling social matching before transactions, we:

- **Solve the stranger problem**: Direct answer to the problem statement
- **Add unique value**: Feature no competitor offers
- **Enhance experiences**: Better events lead to better memories
- **Build community**: Transform transactions into relationships
- **Maintain principles**: No central control, full privacy

This is a **minimal but meaningful** change that maximizes utility without complexity.
